### Hi everyone

I'm a Software Engineer from Hamburg, Germany. I build state-of-the-art developer tooling.

I work at [TypeFox](https://www.typefox.io/), mainly on [langium](https://github.com/eclipse-langium/langium) and [theia](https://github.com/eclipse-theia/theia).

On the side, I work as a lecturer at the [HAW Hamburg](https://www.haw-hamburg.de/). I give lectures on discrete math, logic and computability theory.

You can find out more about me by visiting my [website](https://sujew.dev/).
