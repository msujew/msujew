### Hi everyone ðŸ‘‹

I'm a Software Engineer from Hamburg, Germany. I build state-of-the-art developer tooling.

I act as a project lead for the [Langium](https://github.com/eclipse-langium/langium), [Theia](https://github.com/eclipse-theia/theia) and [Open Collaboration Tools](https://github.com/eclipse-oct/open-collaboration-tools) projects at the [Eclipse Foundation](https://www.eclipse.org/).

I work at [TypeFox](https://www.typefox.io/). Our goal is to make developer tooling easy to build; I'm doing my part by providing modern and high-quality open source frameworks.

On the side, I work as a lecturer at the [HAW Hamburg](https://www.haw-hamburg.de/). Every Friday, I give lectures on discrete math, logic and computability theory.
